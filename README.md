# Clipboard.ninja

Quick and secure way to share text between devices.

See the website [https://clipboard.ninja](https://clipboard.ninja).
Or download the [Android App in the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.trafex.apps.clipboardninja)

See the [source of the Android app on GitHub](https://github.com/TrafeX/clipboard.ninja-app)

## Features

 * It's realtime; you'll see the text immediately appear on the receiving device.
 * It's secure; the connection to the server is encrypted with SSL.
 * It's private; you first need to connect to the other device before you can send something, this way the data never has to be (temporarily) stored on the server. 
 * You can connect with multiple devices, simultaneously receiving the text.
 * No registration is needed, a 6 digit number is enough to connect the devices.

## Usage

You can run a local version with Docker:

    docker-compose up

Go to [http://localhost:3000]()
